The aim of this blog post is to reproduce part of the economic indicators table from ‘The Economist’ using only free tools. We take data directly from DBnomics. The DBnomics API can be accessed through R with the rdbnomics package. All the following code is written in R, thanks to the RCoreTeam (2016) and the RStudioTeam (2016). To update the table, just download the code here and re-run it.
